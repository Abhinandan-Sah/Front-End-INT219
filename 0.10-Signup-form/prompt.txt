Your task is to create HTML and CSS files for a stylish form offering 15% off to new subscribers. The product is called BarkerBox, a monthly subscription box that brings an assortment of unique, playful, and durable toys that dogs will love. 

Please follow the steps below:
 * Create a heading for the product name and offer.
 * Add a short paragraph describing the product and the benefits of subscribing.
 * Build a registration form with a required email input field and a “Get My 15% Off” button.
 * ​​Use the color #471869 for the heading and button, a white background for the form container, and a light body background.

Keep the code as beginner-friendly as possible and document each CSS property with a short code comment to make the code more understandable for non-coders.
