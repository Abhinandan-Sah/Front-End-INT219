        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            With the advent of high-performing internet-enabled devices, HTML has become a popular term. However, what is HTML, and how did it become so crucial for the whole internet? HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Now, what’s a Markup Language, you ask? You can use Markup languages to format the text to provide a visual structure to the document. This page, for example, is also an HTML. HTML belongs to the family of XML (Extensible Markup Language), which uses a set of codes or tags to describe the text in a document. Think of HTML as XML on steroids, which the browser understands how to represent visually.
            HTML is one of the biggest reasons the internet has become what it is today. You can use HTML to build websites, and the ease and simplicity of HTML enable many to develop and build websites. However, it has allowed its users to share web documents seamlessly ever since its inception. These days, Web Developers use it to create excellent web applications while coupling it with JavaScript and a Backend. HTML is something one cannot live without if one works on a computer.

        <h2>Popularity of HTML</h2>
        <p>
            When Tim Berners Lee came up with a proposal that allowed easy sharing of documents at CERN in 1980, he probably didn’t know that HTML would become the literal backbone of the internet we know and love. The most current and widely used version of HTML is HTML5. The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) published the older versions as per the RFC (Request for Comments). The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C for short, is an international community responsible for developing open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web. They do so via RFCs (Request for Comments), which in turn is authored by prominent groups of engineers and computer scientists and individuals. When browser vendors adopt these RFCs, they become standards and browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari implement them. Pretty democratic, eh?
            One could say that since W3C takes concern of so many opinions, HTML is therefore widely used and adopted. HTML is easy to learn and write because it is human-readable. The ease of learning and developing HTML websites makes it very popular.
